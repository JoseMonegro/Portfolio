    <h3>About Jose</h3>
      <p>A few years after graduating High School I stayed in the Dominican Republic for about 10 months.</p>

      <p>I have always dabbled in coding after graduating High School, since it was always an interest of mine, but now I am excited that I have decided to make it my full-time career! I am looking forward to work with other developers. Reach out to me as I have left my contact information on this page below!</p>
